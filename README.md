# Smart-Security-System-using-Raspberry-Pi
This project presents a Smart Surveillance System built using a Raspberry Pi and a camera module, designed to offer real-time video monitoring, automated human detection, and intelligent alerts. It enhances traditional CCTV systems by adding AI-powered face detection and classification, helping users stay informed and secure with minimal manual intervention.

# Project Overview
- The system continuously monitors its environment through a connected camera and processes the live video feed in real-time. When a human face is detected, it performs the following actions automatically:

- Sends instant email notifications to registered email addresses.

- Records only the relevant part of the video where human activity is present.

- Draws bounding circles around detected faces—using different colors for known and unknown individuals, enhancing visual clarity.

- This lightweight and cost-effective solution is ideal for home security, small businesses, or entry-level automation systems.

# Key Features
- Real-time video monitoring using Raspberry Pi and camera module.

- Face detection and classification (known vs unknown).

- Color-coded bounding circles:

   - Green for known faces

   - Red for unknown faces

- Automatic email alerts upon human face detection.

- Smart video recording: Only saves video clips with human presence to conserve storage.

- Edge-computing enabled – Runs directly on Raspberry Pi without the need for cloud servers.

- For added security and consistency, the system is configured to run only on the mobile hotspot it was originally registered with.

# Hardware Components
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (or any compatible version)

- Raspberry Pi Camera Module (or USB webcam)

- Micro SD Card ( 16 GB )

   - Stores Raspberry Pi OS

   - Also used for video file storage

- USB Cables & Power Supply for connectivity and peripheral support

- Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse (used for setup and debugging)

# Use Cases
- Home Entrance Monitoring

- Hostel / Dorm Room Surveillance

- Small Business Security

- Workshop / Lab Monitoring

# Future Improvements
- Add web-based dashboard for viewing logs and live feed

- Integrate motion detection alongside face detection

- Use cloud storage for remote video access

- Deploy a mobile app for push notifications
